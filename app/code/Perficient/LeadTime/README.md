Perficient LeadTime
============================

Last tested on Magento2 version 2.4.0


What I got so far:
----------
This module is used to modify the message according to the product/admin setting after adding the product in cart.

There are two CMS blocks which are managed from Admin:
- Standard Lead Time Notification
    - This block is used to display lead time notification for normal products.
- Quick Ship Lead Time Notification
    - This block is used to display lead time notification for quick ship products.

The lead time notification will be displayed at following areas:
- Shopping Cart
- Order Review
- Order View
- Order Confirmation Email
